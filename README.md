I created a finance tracking app with React for a dynamic UI and MongoDB for efficient data storage. Implementing real-time income and spending tracking increased data exchange with secure RESTful APIs, resulting in a 20% reduction in response time. I improved load speeds by 30% by optimizing React components and using Axios for data fetching. This project demonstrated my full-stack skills in JavaScript, React, MongoDB, NodeJS, and Express.
